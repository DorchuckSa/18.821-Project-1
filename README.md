# 18.821-Project-1
Code for 18.821 Project #1 on research into properties of numbers in the Fibonacci Base.
Developed a class to represent numbers in Fibonacci Number Base.

Implements:
  - Linear Time Addition
  - Linear Time Subtraction
  - O(n^2) Time Multiplication

Usage:
  - python3 fib_class.py: Runs whatever is contained in the main() function of fib_class.py
        * Can modify main() to run different addition/multiplication/subtraction questions for fun

  - python3 tests.py: Runs exhaustive tests on all 3 algorithms.
